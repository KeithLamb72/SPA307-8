/* Use an array to store tasks.
On add.html form submission, validate input using regex and if good, push a new task into the array (you can also store them in localStorage if you want to persist across pages).
On index.html, loop through the tasks array to display each task in a table row.
Show some event handling, like a button click event to remove a task or highlight a row.
